# Analysis on New York City Airbnb Data

This was the final project of "Data Visualization" course of my Master's study. Five research questions were formed and answered using the provided R files. The dataset was collected from kaggle. The five questions are:
1. Is there any significant linear relationship between the numerical variables of the dataset?
2. Does the geographic location have a significant effect on the type of room?
3. Does location has an impact on price?
4. Which type of room is the cheapest and is that more popular among the customers?
5. Depending on the previous analysis, Manhattan is most likely the most expensive area. Does the rent decreases as we go far from Manhattan?

Please, feel free to use the code files as a reference if you would like to do a similar kind of analysis.
